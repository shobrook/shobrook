### Jonathan Shobrook

Iâ€™m a software engineer at Wayfair and an open-source developer. Before this, I was a research programmer at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. I also interned at ROSS Intelligence and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.

Outside of programming, I like to climb mountains (and snowboard on them), practice jiu-jitsu, and play chess.
